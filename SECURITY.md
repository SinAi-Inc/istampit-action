# 🔐 Security Policy

## 📦 Supported Versions

We currently support the **latest major release line** of `istampit-action`. Older versions will generally not receive security updates unless explicitly noted.

| Version | Supported       |
| ------- | --------------- |
| 1.x     | ✅ Supported     |
| < 1.0   | ❌ Not supported |

## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in this project:

1. **Do not open a public GitHub Issue** — this could expose other users before a fix is available.
2. Instead, please email us at: **[security@istampit.io](mailto:security@istampit.io)**
3. You should receive an acknowledgment within **48 hours**.
4. We will provide updates on the status of your report at least once every **7 days** until the issue is resolved.
5. Once confirmed, we will work on a fix and coordinate a disclosure timeline with you.

## 🔏 Disclosure Policy

* Fixes will be released as a **patch version** (e.g., `v1.0.1`).
* Release notes will mention the security fix, but details may be delayed until users have had time to upgrade.
* Credit will be given to reporters if they wish, following responsible disclosure best practices.
